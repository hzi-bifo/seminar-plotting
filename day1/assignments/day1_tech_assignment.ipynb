        "\n",
        "Missing data is one of the most common challenges in data analysis. Before you can analyze or visualize your data, you need to know where the gaps are. The `.isnull().sum()` method provides a clear count of missing values in each column.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What does `.isnull().sum()` do?**\n",
        "- Identifies all null/missing values (NaN) in your DataFrame\n",
        "- Counts how many missing values exist in each column\n",
        "- Returns a Series showing the count for every column\n",
        "\n",
        "**Syntax:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df.isnull().sum()          # Count of null values per column\n",
        "df.isnull().sum().sum()    # Total null values in entire DataFrame\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works (step by step):**\n",
        "1. **`.isnull()`**: Creates a DataFrame of True/False values (True where data is missing)\n",
        "2. **`.sum()`**: Counts the True values (missing entries) for each column\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why is this important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Quality Assessment**: Understand the completeness of your dataset\n",
        "2. **Analysis Planning**: Decide how to handle missing data before proceeding\n",
        "3. **Pattern Recognition**: Some columns might have more missing values than others\n",
        "4. **Decision Making**: Determine if you should drop rows, fill values, or keep them as-is\n",
        "5. **Avoid Errors**: Many statistical functions fail or give incorrect results with missing data\n",

        "\n",
        "**Complementary Functions:**\n",
        "```python\n",
        "df.isnull().any()          # Boolean: Does each column have ANY missing values?\n",
        "df.isnull().sum() / len(df) # Percentage of missing values per column\n",
